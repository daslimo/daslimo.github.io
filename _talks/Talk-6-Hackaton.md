The future of manufacturing lies in Smart Factory Automation, where AI, IoT, and machine learning drive efficiency, precision, and innovation. In my latest lecture, I explored how AI-powered automation is transforming industrial processes, reducing downtime, and enhancing productivity across various sectors. 

**Topic**: Smart Factory Automation: A correlation-based GA-DNN Model for Smart AC Monitoring and Control
My pitch aimed at proposing an AI- based control system that goes through humidity (dehumidification/humidification) and temperature (heating/cooling) processes to keep the temperature and humidity of the air supplied to the factory constant.
