Water security is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time. As an AI researcher, I have had the privilege of sharing insights and innovations at various Kwater & UNESCO i-WSSM events, where I discussed how AI and emerging technologies can drive transformative solutions in water management. 

**Topic**: AI and IoT for Sustainable Water Management
The **Kwater & UNESCO i-WSSM Fall Program on Water Management – Renewable Energy** was a one-week event for selected global researchers, professionals and government bosies for building biateral relationships and meeting sustainable developmental goals via renewable energy. 

📍 At the event, I discussed how AI can enhance predictive flood monitoring, real-time water quality assessment, and smart irrigation systems, explored machine learning applications in optimizing hydropower efficiency and water distribution networks, and discussed the integration of AI and IoT technologies to improve water security, reduce waste, and enhance resource efficiency. Explored AI-based decision frameworks for policy development and implementation.
