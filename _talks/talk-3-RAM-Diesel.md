*My talk centered on the economic,  ethical  and  environmental  impacts  of  unexpected  equipment failure  can  be  overwhelming  and  usually  lead  to  unplanned  maintenance/repair while production activities are delayed, sometimes brought to a halt, underscoring intelligent condition monitoring and assessment hydraulic components, given the likelihood of wear/corrosison in emulsified diesel engines.*
