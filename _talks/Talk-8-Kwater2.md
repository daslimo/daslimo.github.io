Water security is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time. As an AI researcher, I have had the privilege of sharing insights and innovations at various Kwater & UNESCO i-WSSM events, where I discussed how AI and emerging technologies can drive transformative solutions in water management. 

**Topic**: AI-Powered Disaster Resilience & Climate Adaptation
The **Kwater & UNESCO i-WSSM Capacity Building Program on Innovative Technology Applications for Water Security** was a one-week event for selected global researchers, professionals and government bosies for building biateral relationships and meeting sustainable developmental goals via capacity building on innovative technologies. 

📍 At the event, I highlighted AI applications for computer vision-based anomaly detection in pipelines and predictive analytics for infrastructure longevity, engaged in technical workshops developing real-time monitoring frameworks integrating IoT and AI, and addressed AI’s role in early disaster warning systems, climate adaptation strategies, and risk mitigation. Showcased case studies on AI-driven sustainable urban water systems.
