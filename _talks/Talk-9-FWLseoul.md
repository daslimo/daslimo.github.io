The **Falling Walls Lab Seoul** is a platform for visionary thinkers to present ground-breaking ideas that drive scientific and technological advancements. At this prestigious event, I had the opportunity to present my insights on how **Big Data-driven Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)** is shaping the future of industrial reliability.

**The Challenge of Ensuring Optimum Reliability**

Modern production and IT systems are evolving rapidly, but ensuring their optimum reliability has become more demanding due to the exponential growth of Big Data. Yesterday, 5G networks were only a theoretical possibility‚Äîtoday, they are a reality. While their advantages are remarkable, the backstage challenges require more sophisticated solutions than ever before.

**The Role of AI and Machine Learning in Reliability**

The emerging concept of reliability in complex industrial and IT infrastructures is now strongly dependent on Big Data-driven PHM approaches. These techniques leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Reinforcement Learning to enhance system longevity and prevent failures.

**Achieving Zero Losses with Deep Prognostics**

The future of industrial reliability depends on the accuracy, availability, durability, feasibility, usability, safety, and affordability of these advanced PHM techniques. By integrating effective learning algorithms into smart industrial devices and computing systems, we can achieve zero losses, zero accidents, zero downtime, and significantly improved profitability.


**The Takeaway: A Future Without Unplanned Failures**

* With the right AI-powered deep prognostics and health management methods, industries can transition into an era where failures are predicted before they occur, maintenance is proactive rather than reactive, and operational efficiency is maximized. This transformation is already being researched, implemented, and refined to shape the next generation of resilient and intelligent production systems.

* "It won‚Äôt be easy, but it is possible, feasible, and already happening."

* I am grateful for the opportunity to share my vision at Falling Walls Lab Seoul and look forward to collaborating with fellow innovators to break more barriers in AI-driven reliability engineering.
