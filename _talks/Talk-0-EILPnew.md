**Grateful, Inspired, and Ready for More 🚀**

A big thank you to Griffith University, Microsoft, the amazing program organizers, and all the inspiring participants of the Emerging Industry Leaders Program (#EILP2025).

I’m honoured to have played a small part in this pilot initiative—not just attending, but volunteering to support peers through facilitation, team engagement, and feedback. This immersive experience, led by the incredible Deanne Camplejohn and supported by executive coach Graeme Hughes, left me with new insights and a renewed sense of purpose.

**💡 My biggest takeaway?**
>"*To do great things, you must choose to seek and thrive in discomfort. That’s what makes one a leader.*” – Graeme Hughes

To every industry and academic powerhouse who shared their wisdom—thank you. Looking forward to staying connected and seeing where our leadership journeys take us next.
