Despite global patronage, diesel engines still contribute significantly to urban air pollution, and with the ongoing campaign for green automobiles, there is an increasing demand for controlling/monitoring the pollution severity of diesel engines especially in heavy-duty industries. Emulsified diesel fuels provide a readily available solution to engine pollution; however, the inherent reduction in engine power, component corrosion, and/or damage poses a major concern for global adoption. Notwithstanding, on-going investigations suggest the need for reliable condition monitoring frameworks to accurately monitor/control the water-diesel emulsion compositions for inevitable cases. This study proposes the use of common rail (CR) pressure differentials and a deep one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) with the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) for empirical diagnostic evaluations (and validations) using a KIA Sorento 2004 four-cylinder line engine as a case study. CR pressure signals were digitally extracted at various water-in-diesel emulsion compositions at various engine RPMs, pre-processed, and used for necessary transient and spectral analysis, and empirical validations. Results reveal high model trustworthiness with an average validation accuracy of 95.9%. <br/><img src='/images/dieselXAI.png'>
