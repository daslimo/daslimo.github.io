Despite the increasing digitalization of equipment diagnostic/condition monitoring systems, it remains a challenge to accurately harness discriminant information from multiple sensors with unique spectral (and transient) behaviors. High-precision systems such as the automatic regrinding in-line equipment provide intelligent regrinding of micro drill bits; however, immediate monitoring of the grinder during the grinding process has become necessary because ignoring it directly affects the drill bit’s life and the equipment’s overall utility. Vibration signals from the frame and the high-speed grinding wheels reflect the different health stages of the grinding wheel and can be exploited for intelligent condition monitoring. The spectral isolation technique as a preprocessing tool ensures that only the critical spectral segments of the inputs are retained for improved diagnostic accuracy at reduced computational costs. This study explores artificial intelligence-based models for learning the discriminant spectral information stored in the vibration signals and considers the accuracy and cost implications of spectral isolation of the critical spectral segments of the signals for accurate equipment monitoring. Results from one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, respectively, reveal that spectral isolation offers a higher condition monitoring accuracy at reduced computational costs. Experimental results using different 1D-CNN and MLP architectures reveal 4.6% and 7.5% improved diagnostic accuracy by the 1D-CNNs and MLPs, respectively, at about 1.3% and 5.71% reduced computational costs, respectively.<br/><img src='/images/specisolation.png'>
