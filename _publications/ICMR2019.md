A Rolling element bearing (REB) is the heart of rotating components; however, its failure can have
daunting effects; hence the need for accurate condition monitoring and prognostics. In view of
achieving a more comprehensive condition assessment and prognostics of rolling element
bearings, this study proposes a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) feature fusion
technique for degradation assessment, and a deep learning model for prognostics. <br/><img src='/images/Best paper.jpg'>
