Accurate condition monitoring of industrial cyber-physical systems/components demands the use of reliable fault detection and isolation (FD&I) methodologies. Meta-heuristic algorithms for feature selection have good exploration capability for optimal discriminative feature selection for fault isolation/classification of which the Binary Particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is superior to its counterparts. This study presents a robust approach for vibration-based failure diagnostics of electromagnetic/solenoid pumps which employ a multi-domain feature extraction procedure (statistical time-domain and frequency-domain features, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, and continuous wavelet coefficients) for capturing linear and nonlinear properties from the signals. Compared with other filter and wrapper methods for supervised feature selection, a hybrid filter-wrapper (Pearson's correlation-BPSO (ρ-BPSO)) feature selection procedure is proposed for global search of optimal discriminative (uncorrelated) features for fault diagnosis with an RBF-kernel support vector machine (SVM*). Subsequently, a practical case study involving five VSC63A5 solenoid pumps at various operating/fault conditions is presented for validating the performance of the proposed approach. Results show the superior performance of the proposed hybrid filter-wrapper approach against filter-based and wrapper-based techniques for discriminative feature selection. Also, the proposed ρ-BPSO-SVM* diagnostics model performance was compared with other standard fault isolation/classification methods. <br/><img src='/images/access_multi.png'>
