Hi there!👋 **I am a Doctoral Researcher** at [The School of Engineering and Built Environment, Griffith University]("https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-sciences/school-information-communication-technology/institute-integrated-intelligent-systems/our-researchers), Australia where I build human-understandable explanation frameworks for deep learning models. More specifically, I conduct research on 🔎**Explainable AI** for Visual Categorization tasks, 🔓**Computer Vision** and 📝**Reliability Engineering**. My work has been funded by the [ARC Research Hub for Driving Farming Productivity and Disease Prevention](https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-sciences/farming-productivity) and the [Institute for Integrated and Intelligent Systems (IIIS)](https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-sciences/school-information-communication-technology/institute-integrated-intelligent-systems). I've made significant contributions to both fundamental theories and applied research that can solve important industrial problems, and published in prestigious journals and conferences, including:
- IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
- IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems
- IEEE Access
- Journal of Mechanical Science and Technology
- International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)
- Data for Policy, etc.
