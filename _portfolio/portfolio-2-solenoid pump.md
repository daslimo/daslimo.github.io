Despite their relatively smaller sizes, solenoid pumps are capable of generating high-pressures for most low-scale and large-scale industrial applications respectively. They operate by a magnetization of the solenoids (electric coils) when electrical current passes through the coil which then causes the electromagnetic core to move against a spring to slide a diaphragm into the discharge position, thereby pumping fluid. The major objectives of the project are:
* To conduct FMECA on VSC63A5 solenoid pumps and BESCO’s AP3.5/100 external gear pumps
* To design and simulate test beds for multi-failure mode and run-to-failure tests for fault diagnosis and prognosis respectively for the two pumps types respectively.
* To extract vibrational, thermal, and pressure responses (data) for developing AI-based models for intelligent condition monitoring and decision-making.
* To evaluate the performance of the developed models on real industrial equipment for validation. 

I and my team discovered different condition monitoring methodologies for gear pumps and none for solenoid pumps. I explored these existing condition monitoring concepts from distinct analytical researches, as well as their limitations/gaps and drawbacks. I reviewed these design concepts and drawbacks, afterwards I proposed a vibration monitoring approach that is fundamentally dependent on the exploitation of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients from the vibration signals. The VSC series solenoid pumps (manufactured by Korea Control Limited pump fluids (light fuels like kerosene, and diesel) at a maximum discharge flowrate of about 17 Litres/hour; however, the VSC63 model when connected to the specified nozzle (1.0-1.5GPH), pumps fluid (diesel) at a discharge pressure— 0.5-1.0 MPa under normal conditions (an AC power supply of (220V, 60Hz) and room temperature). <br/><img src='/images/solenoid.png'>
