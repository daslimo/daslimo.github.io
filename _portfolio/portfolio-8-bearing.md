Using a run-to-failure (R2F) experiment on four Rexnord ZA-2115 Rrolling element bearings conducted by [The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), USA](https://www.nasa.gov/intelligent-systems-division/discovery-and-systems-health/pcoe/pcoe-data-set-repository/), this project develops a methodology for enhancing rolling element bearing (REB) prognostics by constructing a robust health indicator (HI) through the fusion of multiple highly monotonic statistical features derived from vibration monitoring data. <br/><img src='/images/nasa_exp.png'>

By integrating these features, the framework maps various degradation states and determines the optimal time-to-start prediction (TSP) through clustering algorithms that associate known failure modes with degradation clusters. A significant component of the study is the comparative analysis of predictive models for bearing degradation. It contrasts Bayesian machine learning with deep learning techniques. This comparison addresses critical considerations such as dependency, efficiency, and limitations of each approach.
