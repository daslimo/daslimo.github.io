I deliver instruction and support in engineering and technology programs, guiding students through practical and theoretical aspects of Mechanical Engineering. I facilitate workshops, tutorials, and project-based learning, helping students develop applied problem-solving skills and technical proficiency in tools like MATLAB and Python. My teaching emphasize real-world applications, fostering critical thinking, collaborative learning, and professional readiness. In detail, I do the following:


* Teaching-focused Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering committed to high-quality, student-centred learning
* Deliver engaging postgraduate teaching across core mechanical engineering subjects
* Design and enhance curriculum aligned with accreditation standards and industry needs
* Apply active learning, practical laboratories, and engineering software to connect theory with practice
* Supervise postgraduate projects and contribute to course coordination and teaching innovation
