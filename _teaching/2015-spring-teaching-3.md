At Königin des Friedens College, I delivered structured lessons in mathematics and science while fostering disciplined academic engagement. I developed lesson plans aligned with curriculum standards, simplified complex concepts for diverse learning levels, and prepared students for internal and external examinations.  

Beyond classroom instruction, I mentored students on study strategies, critical thinking, and character development, contributing to both their academic performance and personal growth.
