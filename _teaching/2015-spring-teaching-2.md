At Kumoh National Institute of Technology, I served in a teaching and research support capacity, delivering tutorials and practical sessions in engineering and computational subjects. I guided undergraduate students through core concepts in signal processing, machine learning, and dynamic systems, simplifying complex theories into applied problem-solving exercises. I also mentored students on laboratory work, coding implementation (Python/MATLAB), and research projects, fostering analytical thinking and technical independence. My teaching approach emphasized clarity, structure, and real-world application, helping students bridge theory with hands-on engineering practice. Here are a few:
